# RemedicaAI: An AI-Powered Platform for Sustainable Drug Discovery

## Brief Description
### Problem
The pharmaceutical industry faces massive challenges: drug development is expensive (billions lost annually due to poor ADMET properties causing 90% clinical trial failures), slow, and environmentally damaging. Meanwhile, developing countries like Pakistan generate thousands of tons of unmanaged waste daily—plastics, textiles, agri-waste (e.g., banana peels, coffee grounds)—that's chemically rich but discarded, worsening pollution and missing opportunities for resource recovery.

### Solution
RemedicaAI is a generative AI platform that upcycles waste into potential drug candidates. Users upload an image or describe waste via text; the AI extracts chemical fragments, synthesizes novel drug-like molecules, predicts ADMET properties and EcoScore (biodegradability), validates via RAG on databases like PubChem, and auto-generates a scientific PDF report—all in under 60 seconds.

### Uniqueness
Unlike traditional tools that only analyze or predict, RemedicaAI *creates* and optimizes molecules from real-world waste, integrating multimodal AI (vision + text), fragment-based generation (fine-tuned Llama-3), QSAR modeling, and sustainability scoring. It's a blueprint for eco-innovation, turning national waste crises into biotech opportunities, guided by domain experts like Dr. Hammad Majeed (UMT Lahore). Built for accessibility on Lovable.app, it's scalable for universities, startups, and green pharma.

### How to Use It
1. **Access the App**: Visit the live demo at [https://remedica-waste-whisperer.lovable.app/](https://remedica-waste-whisperer.lovable.app/).
2. **Input Waste Material**: Choose "Upload Image" (drag-drop or browse for a photo of waste like banana peels) or "Text Input" (type the name, e.g., "coffee grounds").
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Material" – wait ~45-60 seconds for AI processing.
4. **View Results**: See compound cards with benefits, applications, side effects, confidence scores, and toxicity levels.
5. **Download Report**: Get the auto-generated PDF with detailed structures, predictions, and insights for further research or sharing.
